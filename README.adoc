== Demo

To be added.

== Installation & usage

Being in early alpha, the project is not distributed through NPM yet.

Add the following runtime requirement to your package.json
(for `current_version`, replace it with latest version per repository tags):

[source]
----
"coulomb": "https://github.com/coulombjs/coulomb#coulomb-<current_version>-gitpkg",
----

Add the following entry to the list `build.extraResources` in your package.json:

[source]
----
{ "from": "./node_modules/coulomb/db/isogit-yaml/main/isogit/worker.js", "to": "isogit-worker.js" }
----

[NOTE]
====
If you are overriding `build.extraResources` for the first time
and you are using `src/static` directory to bundle static assets
during build, you may want to provide the default entry for static assets.

It would probably look like this:

[source]
----
{ "from": "./src/static", "to": "src/static" }
----
====

== Contributing

Coulomb uses Commitizen. To follow commit message conventions,
it is suggested to use `git commit` CLI command, which would show
interactive prompt and format commit message appropriately.

== Release process

Make sure you have `gitkpg` globally installed (`yarn global add gitpkg`).

From repository root:

[source,sh]
----
# Edit dist/package-dist.json to increment version and (if changed) port dependencies from main packgage.json
yarn
cd dist
gitpkg publish
----
